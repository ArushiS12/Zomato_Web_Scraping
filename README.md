<h1>Web Scraping</h1>

Everyday, people access Google to look up the best restaurants nearby because Google has been the best informational resource. However, data scientists have now entered the picture to level the playing field. Through a simple method of Web Scraping, data scientists can provide relevant information that helps a person in making an informed decision in a shorter amount of time with a higher rate of efficiency and satisfaction.

Web scraping is a method to extract large amounts of data from a website. Most of this data is unstructured in HTML format which is then converted into structured data in a spreadsheet or a database so that it can be used in various applications.

Scrapers can extract all the data on particular sites or the specific data that a user wants. Itâ€™s best to specify the data we want so that the web scraper extracts only the desired data quickly.

When a web scraper needs to scrape a site, first the URLs are provided. Then it loads all the HTML code for those sites. Then the scraper obtains the required data from this HTML code and outputs this data in the format specified by the user. Mostly, this is in the form of an Excel spreadsheet or a CSV file, but the data can also be saved in other formats, such as a JSON file.

Here, I have extracted the data for the best dining restaurants in Chennai, Tamil Nadu.
